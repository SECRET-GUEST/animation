# Script print video on meshed objects

This code creates a new material in Blender and applies an image texture to it. The material is applied to either a single object, a selection of objects, or a selection of faces in edit mode. The user can specify the material name, path to the video file to be used as a texture, and the emission strength of the material.

## Features

- Creates a new material and applies an image texture to it
- Allows for three different ways to apply the material: to a single object, a selection of objects, or a selection of faces in edit mode
- Customizable material name, texture path, and emission strength
- Removes existing nodes before creating new ones
- Loads video into an Image Texture node and configures it
- Creates necessary nodes and defines node positions
- Creates links between nodes to set up the material
- Selects faces with the material when applied in edit mode


## Usage:
1. Open Blender and create a new scene
2. Open a text editor window and paste the script into it
3. Customize the key dimensions, spacing, and padding variables in the script as desired
4. Customize the keyboard layout and custom key sizes in the script as desired
5. Run the script
6. The resulting keyboard model will be created in a new collection named "Keyboard"
7. Export the model in the desired format for use in other software. 


## Tutorials

### Edit Mode Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the "edit_faces" option in the script to apply the material to a selection of faces in edit mode. 

### UV Mapping Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the UV Mapping mode to position the video in Blender. It shows how to manually enter the number of frames and click on the cyclic mode to make the image repeat. It also shows how to enable auto-refresh to play the animation. 

### Material Nodes

This image shows the material nodes generated by the script.
