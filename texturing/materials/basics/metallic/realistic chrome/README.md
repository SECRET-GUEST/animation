# Script for Ultra-Realistic Chrome Material in Blender

This code creates a new ultra-realistic chrome material in Blender using only the built-in shaders. The material can be applied to a single object, a selection of objects, or a selection of faces in edit mode.

Here you got a visual explanation on how to make it manually on [toericht youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co1uZvyVvjE&ab_channel=toericht)
I used his tutorial to make the scripts, so don't forget to like and subscribe ^^ !

## Features

- Generates a new ultra-realistic chrome material using Blender's shaders.
- Provides flexibility in applying the material: to a single object, multiple objects, or specific faces in edit mode.
- Configures and links nodes to achieve the desired chrome effect.
- Adapts to existing materials by appending a number to the material name if it already exists.

[You can find here an example of this material used to make an iridescent castle, with some assets to download ](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JvJmyA)

## Usage:

1. Open Blender and select your desired object or face.
2. Open a text editor window within Blender and paste the script into it.
