# Blender Scripts Collection

This repository branch hosts a variety of scripts created to enhance your experience with Blender. Whether you are looking to automate certain tasks, or introduce new functionalities into your workflow, these scripts are designed with versatility and ease-of-use in mind.

### [Additionnaly, I made a GPT to help you make scripts here](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-q2GEXaTWl-3d-with-blender)

## :wrench: Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the specific script you need.
2. Open Blender.
3. Navigate to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Add-ons` > `Install`.
4. Locate and select the script file, then click `Install Add-on`.
5. Once installed, the script can be accessed and configured within Blender.

## :gem: Recommendations  

- Discover more simplified scripts without a GUI that are nonetheless user-friendly: [Tiny Scripts](https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/tiny-scripts)

- Explore scripts for other creative software in the various branches of this repository: [Main Branch](https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/animation/tree/main)

- Instead of using the integration scripts in the 'extractor' folder, you also have the option to use my other script to manage all Python files from this branch (for example). You can do this with this tool: [link to the tool](https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/file_organizer). It requires self-compilation, but if you don't need the GUI, you can use this script version of the tool: [link to the script version](https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/tiny-scripts/tree/ALL/C/Files%20handlers/File%20organizer).
