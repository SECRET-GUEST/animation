# Description:
This script provides a way to generate a bundle of intertwined cables in Blender, like to simulate guts or cyberpunk / biopunk cables column,...  

The cables are created using Bézier curves, with each curve being constructed from a series of control points. 

The points are generated based on a start and end position, with an additional noise factor applied to create a more organic appearance. 

You can customize various parameters, such as the number of cables, thickness of the cables, and the noise factor, to achieve the desired look for their character.

# features:

* Generates a bundle of intertwined cables suitable for a cyberpunk-style character's neck.
* Utilizes Bézier curves to create smooth, complex cable shapes.
* Allows for customization of parameters such as cable thickness, number of cables, and noise factor.
* Automatically removes previously created mesh and curve objects to prevent clutter in the Blender scene.
